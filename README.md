# BD_Tests
This program is a specialized dependency analysis system for banking software modules. It automatically maps software components to their corresponding database tables, tracks all inter-module relationships (including direct and transitive dependencies), and links them to relevant unit, integration, and regression tests. Upon request, it provides a complete overview: from detailed information about a selected module and a list of all components it depends on or that depend on it, to the full suite of tests required to verify the entire involved chain. This functionality is critical for change management, impact assessment, and maintaining reliability within complex banking IT infrastructure.
